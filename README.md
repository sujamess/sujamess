# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Surarerk Boonjit!
I'm a software engineer with a passion for building cutting-edge software that drives innovation and solves complex problems. Currently, I'm working at [Q-CHANG](https://www.q-chang.com) and contributing to a Go web framework called [Cheetah](https://github.com/go-cheetah/cheetah).

## ðŸš€ My current project: [Cheetah](https://github.com/go-cheetah/cheetah)
Cheetah is a lightning-fast, flexible, and powerful web framework that enables developers to build high-performance web applications with ease. Its simple and intuitive design allows developers to focus on their application logic, and its extensibility enables them to build a custom solution to fit their specific needs. If you're looking for a lightweight and performant web framework, Cheetah is your perfect choice!

We welcome contributors of all levels of experience to help make Cheetah even better

## ðŸ”§ Technologies and tools
I have experience working with a diverse range of technologies and tools and enjoy expanding my skillset by exploring new ones. Some of my current favorite ones include:
- Programming languages: Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust
- Web frameworks: Cheetah (Go), net/http (Go), Echo (Go), Fiber (Go), NestJS (Node.js)
